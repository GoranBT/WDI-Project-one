### [](https://github.com/GoranBT/WDI-Project-one)Description

This project was to build a JavaScript browser game, I chose to build a icon slicing  game(based on fruit ninja). That allows players to chose from a login name, play and stop the audio player, start slicing programming icons and follow the score and level.
- Players can not start and stop the game while playing.
- Players can not change the log in details while playing.
- Bonus quiz icon
- Bonus multi-slice icon

- Heroku

### [](https://github.com/GoranBT/WDI-Project-one)Challenges faced

The biggest challenge of the game was the timers functionality. The game is based on random css changes  based on lots of in-game timers (one setInterval is not enough). Initially, I tried to make a function that loops and clear all of the timers.

### [](https://github.com/GoranBT/WDI-Project-one)Rounding it off

Improvements that I would like to make to the project in the future would be:

- Adding an bonus level mini game.
- Improvement to the UI, particularly movements, slices, sounds.
- Add additional data attributes to the player objects, e.g. Upload their own picture.
- Add some negative icons (bombs) that will take 1 life - when sliced.
